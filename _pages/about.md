Welcome! I am a research scientist at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE).
My current research interest is everything related to neuroscience, but especially consciousness and learning.
I'm also strongly interested in Type 1 Diabetes and the Artificial Pancreas (AP).
I previously worked as a Health App Developer in both private and commercial projects.
You can learn more about my work on this page, you can read for example publications and project blog posts.
