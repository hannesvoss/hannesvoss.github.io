Welcome! I am interested in cognitive processes in the human brain. Especially the replication of these processes in cognitive
systems. Furthermore, I am also interested in whole-brain modeling based on connectomes, especially the subfield of bio-inspired connectomes (transfer of empirically collected structural connectomes from fMRI/EEG/... data), enabling continuous learning from these inspired neural networks and the analysis of these. I am also strongly interested in Type 1 Diabetes and the application of machine learning to a variety of diabetes related challenges like unannounced meal prediction and automated continuous insulin delivery. I previously worked as a Health App Developer in both private and commercial projects. You can learn more about my work on this page, you can read for example publications and project blog posts.

If you are interested in working with me, please feel free to contact me via one of the options on the left.
